The first part of this passage
from the road of Baleise
to Baccalar, is entirely
by water; first coast-ways
to the entrance of the Rio
Hondo, from thence through an
arm of that river, that leads to three
small Lagoons, till you arrive at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>lake of Baccalar, on whose banks
the town and castle of St. Philips is
situated. The distance from Baleise
to the entrance of the Rio
Hondo, is near thirty leagues, and
in sailing has much the appearance
of a straight or broad river, from
the number of small island or quays,
(as they are there called) that lay
at about five or six leagues distance
from the main, and parallel with it;
both the islands and main are very
flat, the former of which are for
the most part covered with the Mangrove
and palmeta trees; ’tis rare
to see a beach, on either the main
or the quays, for the Mangrove;
the course up is about the N.N.W.
and in general very shoaly, so much
so at many places, that the <i>Flatts</i>
which (the baymen use to carry their
logwood) of about four or five feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>draught of water often ground, and
in some particular places, raise the
mud for a mile together. In short,
the navigation on this part of the
coast, from Baleise to the Rio
Hondo, is as much a pilot’s water
for those boats, as the Thames is
for ships from London to the Nore;
the quays abound with Goannas, of
which we shot several, going ashore
for that purpose, and many Allegators
lurk in the shoal water under
the Mangrove bushes; we were
accompanied by a master of a merchant
ship (a lieutenant in the navy)
in his long boat, partly out of compliment,
and partly out of curiosity,
to see the country and Baccalar;
myself going into the Rio Hondo,
with one Maud, one of the most
considerable bay merchants, in one
of his Flatts, which boats have a tolerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>good cabbin, and are schooner
rigg’d.  The entrance of the
Rio Hondo is narrow, not more
than a hundred yards over, or a half
cables length, and is very deep,
as from its name Hondo, signifying
the same in the Spanish. About
a quarter of a mile from the river’s
mouth, and open to the sea, on the
north shore, is a look out, which is
generally kept by a sergeant’s, but
sometimes a corporal’s guard, which
is weekly relieved from the garrison
at Baccalar, from which, thro’
the woods, it is distant only about five
Spanish leagues, and from hence notice
is given of whatever comes into
the river to the commandant; this
is called the lower look out. I must
not here omit observing, how much
it is the interest of the baymen (and
which indeed they never fail to avail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>themselves of) to be on good terms
with the guards of these outposts;
this my friend the merchant did,
by making the sergeant and his
guard very drunk, that he not only
told him where they had discovered
a good spot of logwood, but am
persuaded, had he discovered a mine
as rich as Potosi, he would have
made no scruple of informing him
of it; the officer of these commands,
which is generally a sergeant, is besides
this scene of jollitry, often
complimented with a piece of strip’d
cotton, or some such light stuff, to
make him a shirt, waistcoat or trowsers,
or perhaps a pair of European
shoes for his wife. These little presents
the commandant of Baccalar is not
totally insensible of, and is often
mean enough to be very jealous of, as
it in a manner affects him, who is both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>commander and clothier; this Mr.
Maud told me was one of the principal
reasons of the late disturbances
in the bay; the commandant of
Baccalar being offended at this generosity
of the English, hurting his
priviledge so much, as to make him
persuade the late governor of the
province, that it had never been customary
for the English to cut wood
in the Rio Hondo, and in doing
which they had gone beyond the limits
of the treaty of Paris.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tho’ the baymen consider their
right by that treaty, from Cape Catouch
to Cape Honduras; this was
redressed by virtue of an order from
the court of Spain, in favour of the
cutters, in consequence of a remonstrance
of our ministry in 1764, the
duplicate of which order, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>with Sir William’s letter, I was encharged
with.</p>

<p class='c006'>In sailing from this to the next
look out, you open a fine Lagoon on
the south side of the river, about a
league and a half from the lower
look out; its called by the baymen
the four mile Lagoon, but by the
Spaniards the Zaho Mal; its of an
oval form, about half a league in its
shortest breadth, and pretty deep;
in this Lagoon our companion, the
master of the merchantman, lost his
long boat, oversetting in a squall,
in turning out of the Lagoon, to
get into the river, where we had,
to avoid the insects, musquetoes, &#38;c.
anchored for the night; the river
here abouts is so narrow, as scarce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to afford room for the boom of the
mainsail to gibe; they have a custom
when they stop in the river on
any occasion, to bush the Flatt, as
they term it, which is no more than
to luff round and drive her bowsprit
and entangle it in the bush,
which sides the Flatt, the stream
being very weak.</p>

<p class='c006'>The upper look out is from the
river’s mouth, about four Spanish
leagues, and is situated at the entrance
of a small creek (almost hid
by the Mangroves) on the north
shore of the river that opens to the
passage to Baccalar; the course up
the river to this place is about N.
S. W. here also is a sergeant’s guard;
it was at this place the commandant of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span> Baccalar came in his Parriagua, to
carry me up, having advice from
the lower look out of my arrival
in the river.—Here, on my coming
on shore, I was saluted with
four patereroes, brought seemingly
on purpose, the guard in
every respect like the lower lookout.—We
were prevented the
pleasure of returning this salute,
by the loss of our long boat,
which the master had equipped
with swivels for the purpose, as
we were apprized of these compliments.
This Creek is called
the Cheeque, where, after the ceremony
of signing vouchers for the
commandants having admitted us
into the river, &#38;c. and a repast of
chocolate, we all imbark’d on board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>his Parriagua for Baccalar. The
passage now becomes very intricate,
through a very narrow channel,
and rapid stream, that often
throws the boat into the bushes.
At the extremity of this narrow
rivulet is a corporal’s guard, open
to the first of the three beforementioned
Lagoons; the passages between
which are so very difficult,
that none but a well acquainted
person could navigate one of those
kind of boats of five or six inches
draught to Baccalar; but I observed
that the general course was about
N.N.E. and the distance six or seven
leagues. We arrived at Baccalar after
seven or eight hours passage, about
ten at night, during which nothing
material happen’d, unless our being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>disturb’d by an Allegator; which
our boat in its passage had awaked,
as it lay on the water: our boat
was frequently trackt by hand, thro’
many of the channels, being very
narrow and shoaly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Baccalar is a small, poor, straggling
village, of ill-built huts, of
stakes of the Palmeta-tree drove
in the ground, plaistered with
earth, and thatched with the leaves;
in number not more than a hundred
Spaniards and Indians, of the
former they are most of the soldiers
militia of the province. It has
nothing to recommend it but its
situation, which is extreamly pleasant;
being on the summit of a
rising ground; on the north side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>the lake is bounded by a pleasing
prospect of woods, at an agreeable
distance on the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fort or castle of St. Phillips
is also situated on the summit of
this little hill, not more than a
hundred yards from the shore of
the Lake, is in form of a square,
with salient angles: it faces to the
four Cardinal Points; has four
pieces of ordnance on each side,
about twelve pounders, and one
from each angle to cover the ditch,
which is dry, and palisadoed, but
no out-work: they have swivels
mounted on the Marlons; not being
invited to see it, cannot be
very particular in my description
of it: It is garrisoned by a company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of foot, and some few militia
of the town, but so very undisciplined,
and ill cloathed, they have
scarce the appearance of Falstaff’s
company of soldiers.</p>

<p class='c006'>From hence a traveller must furnish
himself with every necessary
for a journey of three days, having
a wilderness, as they call it, a
wood of about thirty-four Spanish
leagues to the first Indian town,
call’d Chumhubut: it is also best
to take your own liquor with you
for the whole journey, as there is
not any to be had in this country
except Aquadent, which is very
bad, scarce, and dear. As to the
acquiring my necessaries, provisions,
mules, indians, &#38;c. I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>no trouble with that, the commandant
with whom I lived, during
my residence in this town of three
days, took all that on himself, for
which I had no other trouble but
to pay him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being equipped with every necessary,
as mules, indians, interpreters,
and hammocks of that
country, to be carried in case of
wearying, or to sleep in the night,
you enter the wood, whose path in
general is from fifteen to twenty
feet wide; often interrupted by
the fall of large trees; through
which, however, a path is generally
burnt by the first traveller,
to admit a horse to pass,
and is in general as well screen’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>from the sun (by the meeting
branches over head) as the Mall in
St. James’s Park. Here you see
at every four or five leagues distance,
a shed like what our common
smith’s, or farriers use to shoe
their horses in, and is what the
natives call a Rings house: Being
built by order of the governor, for
the convenience of travelling; as
there is not, as in Europe, houses
of entertainment, or lodging, they
answer the purpose very well in
this climate, where you have your
own provisions, and sleeping convenience
with you; as they shelter
from the sun and rain, and are
always built near the water, either
a Lagoon or branch of one, or
what may be left from the rains.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>The woods consist chiefly of mahogany,
cedar gopal, (of which
they make a kind of gum elemy)
the small and wild cotton, palmeta,
and cocoa nuts, and many aloes,
not much incommoded with under
brush: it is the swampy ground
that abounds with the logwood,
which the Spaniards call Palo Tinto.
In travelling thro’ the swamps it is
very troublesome, the mules being
knee deep, in the dry season, in a
stiff blueish mud, often times nearly
sticking fast, and the boughs of
the logwood trees so low, as to
oblige you to lay flat on the mules
shoulders, whilst the animal is all
that time plunging in endeavouring
to extricate himself from the
mire. Of game there is the quarm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and curasoe birds, nearly as big
as turkeys, and very fine food.
Of beasts, wild deer and the
warree<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, or musk hog. There are
some wild beasts, as tygers, and
some others, whose names I don't
remember, but ’tis rare they are
troublesome; travellers make no
account of them. Parrots and
Monkeys are also very numerous
in the woods, as is common with
those climates.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Warree is the Tajacu, or Musk
Hog of Mexico; the Universal Dictionary of
Arts and Sciences gives an account of this
animal; it is very good food.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>After passing the wilderness, the
journey becomes more pleasant, always
dining and sleeping in an
Indian town; and in rather better
houses than the former, they being
staked closer, and plaistered
with earth: these are also built
by the governor’s order, for the
same purpose as those in the woods.
Here a chief of the Indians always
resides, being obliged so to do, to
be ready to furnish travellers with
every thing necessary they may
want; prepare their victuals; get
them fresh mules and Indians, who
travel at the order of this chief,
who is a kind of alderman in the
village; you pay only for the mules,
and that very cheap. This Pazique,
or Chief, always assembles about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>half a dozen of natives of the
town, of both sexes. As soon as
he discovers you coming into the
town, by a particular shout, they
prepare your victuals, wash your
feet with warm water, and make
every thing ready for your setting
off again; the diet is generally
fowls, eggs, or young pork; chocolate
and maize bread, all very
cheap.</p>

<p class='c006'>From Chunhuhub to Merida is
about fifty-seven Spanish leagues,
and may be said to be entirely thro’
the woods, tho’ not so thick and
lofty as the wilderness; and frequently
as you approach the capital,
opens to plantations; the
path very serpentine, scarce ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>seeing two hundred yards before
you; the soil a reddish clay; very
rocky; and the country low, level,
and badly water’d, not crossing
one river in a journey of ninety-one
leagues from Baccalar to Merida.
There is in every town a public
well sunk with much difficulty,
thro’ a strata of hard rock, some
of these are very deep; the water
is in general hard, tho’ not unpalatable.
The people are healthy,
and, as they say, remarkable for
their longevity. From the wood
to Merida you pass fourteen Indian
towns; in every one of which is a
kind of church, or place of worship;
tho’ one priest often officiates
for three of these villages; riding
from one to the other, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>half way houses, or sheds, built
for them by the poor Indians to
secure them from rain; they appear
to be superlatively ignorant,
by what I could discover, thro’ the
inconvenience of an interpreter;
of course can but ill impart with
their small stock of knowledge to
their flock, who they keep in the
most obscure ignorance, and abject
servility, shewing both by their
adoration of such divines. They,
however, behaved very polite and
civil towards me, always waiting
at the king’s house to receive me;
even when I have come in late at
night, have invited me to come
to sup with them, offer’d me
lodging in their houses, complimented
me with then best mule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>to proceed  on my journey, and
often a nosegay from the bosom
of our virgin mother, not without
hinting for a little present to the
church; and some English rum for
their poor congregation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Merida is a handsome well built
town, in form a square; the streets
are spacious, parallel to each other,
and cross at right angles, but have
only the foot paths pav’d; it is built
on a sandy soil; has a handsome
arch’d gate way at the end of every
street, next the country, but no gates
hung: the houses are low built of
stone, and white wash’d; the out
side of which, in this country,
has bad effect on the eyes; it contains,
as I was told, about twenty-four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>churches, a good cathedral, a
convent of nuns, and a monastery
of fryars, of the order of St. Francis;
two or three good squares; in the
principal of which, and on the
north side, resides the governor;
and has the cathedral and bishop’s
palace on the east; the grand council
house on the west; and houses
of the principal inhabitants form
the south side: there is but little
appearance of commerce, or any
mechanic art; very few public
shops, but all appearing like people
living on their own private fortune;
and many are such; who live on
the acquired wealth of their ancestors;
while the indolence of
many others prompts them to no
industry or commerce; contented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>to live on the small profits of a
plantation, and that cultivated by
the Indians: but there is a small
trade coast-ways to Campeachy,
from the port of Sifal (which is
distant only twelve leagues) in bees’
wax, leather, gopal, ebony, and
logwood; but this a stranger cannot
immediately discover. The
revenues of the province to the
crown of Spain are very considerable,
arising mostly from the article
of cotton, with which the
woods abound.</p>

<p class='c006'>The citadel, or castle, stands
on a level spot of ground (as the
country is in general); as you
enter the town, from the eastward,
it is of no consequence, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>originally built to protect the Friars
from the insolence of the natives:
it at present incloses a monastery
of the Franciscans beforementioned;
it is in form an hexagon,
with salient angles; with light pieces
about four and six pounders mounted,
some brass, some iron. The
wall about ten yards high, has no
ditch, or out-work. The governor’s
nephew is the commandant,
who shew’d it me; ’tis by no
means in a condition to defend
itself against any foreign enemy
that have artillery: a company of
foot do duty here, and at the
governor’s house, but a troop of
horse, which are part here, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>rest at Campeachy, escort the governor
when he goes out. I was
credibly inform’d, there was not
five hundred troops in the whole
province.</p>

<p class='c006'>The dress of the Spaniards in
this country is very light; the men
wear a light linen waistcoat and
trowsers, and drawers; the better
sort, a sattin one (scarce ever wearing
a coat) with a white linen
cap, and a broad brim straw hat.
The women, of the lower class, a
single petticoat only, no stays,
or any other cloathing above the
waist, except their shift; their bosoms
no way concealed, but bare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to the nipples of their breast; indeed,
when they go out on a
visit, even those who keep their
calash, have no more than a silk
scarf loosely flung over their shoulders;
this is crimson sattin, generally
embroidered: they are for the
most part pretty: some of them of
very fair complexions; they wear
their hair braided behind, and tied
in two different bows, with pink
ribbons, and are very free and unreserved.
I would be understood
here, with respect to the provincials
only; the old Castilians (as
they call themselves) they being
such as hold offices under the
crown, or those who come for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the sake of trade; they dress as
in Old Spain, and hold the other
inhabitants in very little esteem.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Jucatan Indians are a most
willing, obliging, meek temper’d
people; very laborious; of midling
stature, and well featur’d:
their hair strait and black, but cut
short, except a lock on each side
their temple, which they are constrained
to wear as a badge of
subjection to the Spanish monarchy.
Their dress is a kind of
short frock, reaching to the waist,
and trowsers; a straw hat, and
sandals: but when they travel, they
proceed quite naked, except a cloth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to hide their privities. They are very
active and dexterous in the woods
with their muschalls, an instrument
something between a knife
and a cleaver, with which they
clear away the bush in the woods,
dress their meat, and use it as
an instrument of offence on occasion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The women are, in general,
short and thick set, with agreeable
countenances; their hair black,
which they generally wear club’d
behind; and those near Merida,
with a pink ribband: they go
bare leg’d, with a short cotton
petticoat, which they adorn about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the bottom, with flowers of various
colours, in needlework: as
also their frocks, in the same manner,
round the bosoms. These
are always made of cotton, of
their own spinning and weaving:
the frock reaches only to the upper
part of the petticoat, but this
they throw off when employ’d on
any domestick business, going naked
to the waist.</p>

<p class='c006'>The police of each of these
towns, is managed by the following
officers, whose titles I am
better acquainted with than their
office: they are always of the
best repute, and fair character;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>elderly men of the town, and have
great respect shewn them by the
Indians: they stand in rank as I
here name them, the Cazique,
Teniente, Alcaldi, and Fiscal;
who reside at what is called the
king’s house, and adjust all civil
causes: they are distinguished by
several badges; the Alcaldi wearing
a square blue cloth embroidered
at the corners, hung to his
left shoulder. The Teniente, a
wand, with a cross at the top of
it. The Fiscal wears a key, and
a kind of cat with three tails, being
by office both the prison-keeper,
and executor of punishment.
These badges of his offices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>he always wears to his waist, hung
to a sash round his body. They
have in each of these houses, a
serivan, or clerk, who minutes the
arrival and departure of expresses
going to or from Merida, or from
any of the towns in the province.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their towns are poor, mean
huts, built with stakes of Palmeta,
(which they chuse for their
straitness) and thatched, with the
leaves to the ground, resembling
a large beehive. They have no
upper room, no more than the
provincial Spaniards, and like them,
sleep all in their grass hammocks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>as they are called, though they
are made of the thready fibres of
the leaves from the aloe-tree, in
the same manner as hemp is got
from the stalk; they just throw
a cotton cloth over them; and
when travelling, if night overtakes
them, they sleep in these hammocks,
hung between two trees;
never neglecting however, to make
a good wood fire close to their
hammocks. Their diet is very
simple, being no more than a
maize cake, and a little pasoli to
drink; a liquor made of the meal
of the maize, left in water till
it ferments, and grows four: this
generally they sweeten with honey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of which they find great plenty
in the woods.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their principal employment is
the cultivation of the plantations;
they train their children to the
practice of the bow and arrow;
and with which they kill their
game, not being permitted to use
fire arms.</p>
